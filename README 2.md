I wanted this to be a single page app to allow for an easy-to-navigate page.

**Unsolved Problems**

- I am hoping to use this layout and create a blog that will be up and running to continue my brand as a whole.

- While it is very responsive there are a few things that I did not edit perfectly to my liking.

- Still need to add certain hover effects and fade in and fade out effects.
